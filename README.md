## Description 
Just picked up roller skating as your new quarantine hobby but can't find any safe places to skate outdoors? Let's Roll is the perfect companion for quad skaters! This mobile-first, Progressive Web Application provides quad skaters with information on the best places to skate outdoors in their area.

Visit Let's Roll to view all kinds of skate places: parks, outdoor rinks, trails, and more! If you stumble upon a place isn't listed, create an account to log-in and add your own skate place. With Let's Roll you can spend less time researching and more time rolling with the homies!

## Usage

Visit https://gt-lets-roll.herokuapp.com/ on your mobile phone to get started! We recommend saving the web page to your home screen for easy access!

You will be prompted to log in if you have an account, or create an account if you do not have one. If you are not logged in you can still view all skate places and tutorials!

The All Skate Places page will display all places. Use the filter to filter by type!

Add new skate places of your own by filling out the form - these places will be added to the All Skate Places for everyone to view. You can edit and delete your skate places.

Visit the tutorials page for some skating pointers!

When you are finished with your session, log out.

## Technologies Used

This is a MERN application that was built using React and Material UI for the front end. This application is backed by Mongo DB and an Express/Node backend. We utilized JWT for user authentication. We incorporated the animate.css library to add animation as well.

 ## Acknowledgments
 We would like to thank the Peach Skate FB group for providing us with seed data for these awesome skate places! The instructional staff at our Georgia Tech Bootcamp was also extremely helpful throughout this entire process - they were there to help us squash all the bugs and think through creative solutions to problems!
